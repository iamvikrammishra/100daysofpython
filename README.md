# 100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository contains 100 Python projects that I have created as part of Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is designed to help you develop your programming skills by coding every day for 100 days. Each day involves building a new project, learning new concepts, and applying them in practical scenarios.

## Projects Overview

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a day and contains the project of the day. Below is a brief overview of some of the projects you will find:

- **Day 1: Band Name Generator**
- **Day 2: Tip Calculator**
- **Day 3: Treasure Island Game**
- **Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors**
- **Day 5: Password Generator**
- **Day 6: Escape the Maze**
- **Day 7: Hangman Game**
- **Day 8: Caesar Cipher**
- **Day 9: Secret Auction Program**
- **Day 10: Calculator Program**
- ... (and so on until Day 100)

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-code-python.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd 100-days-of-code-python/DayXX
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    Each project can be run using Python. For example:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Daily Log

I will be documenting my progress daily. Here are my logs:

### Day 1: Band Name Generator
- **Concepts learned**: String manipulation, input/output
- **Project details**: A fun program that generates a band name based on user input.

### Day 2: Tip Calculator
- **Concepts learned**: Basic arithmetic, type conversion
- **Project details**: A simple calculator that computes the tip amount based on the bill and desired tip percentage.

... (and so on)
